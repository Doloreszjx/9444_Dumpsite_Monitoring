# 9444_Dumpsite_Monitoring

# Group name : HD_plz

## Project Introduction

This project designed three models to localize dumpsite positions from satellite imagery and estimate their categories.

## Files structure:

- **Purpose**: A overview of project report, including description of the project, review existing methods/techniques relevant to the project, models, experimental setup, results, conclusions.

### image_info

- **Purpose**: Contains images in the notebook, such as original label distribution, balanced label distribution, confusion_matrix.

### submit_notebook.ipynb

- **Purpose**: A Jupyter Notebook designed for conducting data analysis and experiments, including all necessary dependencies.

# Contributors

## We would like to thank the following people who have contributed to this project:

- **Jiaxin Zhang** - Data Processing and model(YOLOv8) used in the training part and add the CBAM to compare the analysis.

- **Jinyun Luo** - Training and testing of different backbone networks of the model (Faster-R-CNN), and comparing and analyzing the results

- **Wenqi Zheng** - Provided solutions for yolov8 model optimization, investigated existing relevant literature, and provided documentation support for model selection and model optimization

- **Chen Duan** - Evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics, optimize the model and analyse the results.

- **Jiakang Lai** - Tuning hyperparameters of models to improve performance, analyzing real-world applications of projects, analyzing model limitations and future challenges
